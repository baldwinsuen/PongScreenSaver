# PongScreenSaver

Custom ping pong screen saver project; written in Swift, exclusively for Mac.


## TODO

- The ball tends to exit at the top of the screen and hit some invisible wall that cant be seen to the user
  - Lets try having the ball stay within the bounds of my screen
  - BONUS: Instead of going back and forth randomly, maybe I can add another ball that interacts with the original ball
    - Shown in different colors, each ball will have a paddle that follows their respective ball
      - make the paddle look like a little monster that eats the ball then spits it out

### Bad Practices

- Commited xcodeproj file into Github repo. For the sake of time I wont be excluding this project folder but in the future, look at this article for best practices.
